# Overview

This was a two week sprint challenge where I tried to learn C++. I have been programming for about a year now and started with the python language.
The syntax for C++ is a lot less forgiving, I found out fast but, it is very powerful for running quick applications. 

I always like playing DnD (Dungeons and Dragons), but have never liked rolling to set up your character. I think it just slows the whole first session down.
I built some software in C++ to allow you to roll for your character's ability scores. A character will have six abilities scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.
This software rolls four 6-sided dice for you and omits your lowest row. It then adds the other three rolls and then allows you to assign the score to one of your abilities. It is a super fast set up
for creating your character.

# Development Environment

g++ version 9.2.0

I used the C++ language and pulled some things from the STD Library of C++.
